    <h3>Description of Recipe:</h3>
    <p>
        This is a recipe for Korean beef short ribs, AKA "LA Galbi". One of the easier, tasty and quick meal option
        that can be made with some prep and frying.
        Obtained from Koreanbabsan.

        Purchase 3-4 lbs of sliced beef short ribs. Wash in cold water to remove bone particles and allow to drain. 
        Grate 1/2 Korean pear, 1/2 medium onion and mix with 2 tbsp minced garlic and 1 tsp of minced ginger. If 
        possible, blend all of these together. Then mix with 1/2 cup soy sauce, 1/2 cup water, 1/4 cup sugar, 
        2 tbsp honey, 1/4 cup mirin, and 2 tbsp of sesame oil. Place the short ribs into this marinade. Allow it to 
        marinade x 3-4 hours, ideally overnight.
    </p>
    <p>
        After it is done marinading, heat up a cast iron/bbq grill to high, and fry each short rib. Do not remove
        excess marinade prior to frying. Once all are fried, sprinkle sesame seeds and sliced scallions to taste.
